Single Agent Navigation*
A simple longer boid agent travels from a starting point to a defined end point avoiding obstacles

Orientation Smoothing - Entirely present
Flock of boids in environment always face the direction they are travelling and smoothly change orientation

User Scenario Editing+ - End of the video and during the video when the white spots change
The boids flock can be added to using the mouse click left button and the obstacles can be randomly reassigned using the "R" key

Multiple Agents Planning+ - During the video
All the boids in the scene are constantly avoiding each other and staying near each other

Incorporate Particle System - During the video
The boids act as a particle system against the obstacles

Crowd Control - 
Each boid targets each other when spawned in and act to meet each other and average alot of values together

Difficulties - 
Getting each boid to individualy be affected by both the obstacles and the moving bigger boid
Getting the bigger boid to reset each time I moved the obstacles without messing with the planned path
When testing the path and visually the nodes the screan was so cluttered because of the few amount of obstacles I was using

Libraries - A modified version of Boids by Craig Reynolds Boids artificial life program
